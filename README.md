# Azure API Management Integration with App Service

## Objective

The project aimed to integrate Azure API Management (APIM) with an Azure App Service. The goal was to create and configure the necessary Azure resources, integrate a web app with API Management, and test the deployed API. This project demonstrated advanced skills in Azure resource management, API integration, and web application hosting.

### Skills Learned

- Provisioning Azure API Management: Creating and configuring an API Management instance using the Azure Portal.
- Creating and Managing Azure App Services: Setting up an App Service Plan and deploying a web app.
- API Integration: Integrating Azure App Services with API Management for API exposure.
- Testing and Validation: Conducting tests to ensure successful integration and API functionality.
- Managing API Endpoints and Security: Configuring API endpoints, managing security settings, and enabling CORS in API Management.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure: For hosting and managing the web application and API services.
- Azure API Management: For exposing and managing the APIs.
- Azure App Service: For hosting the web application.
- Azure Portal: For configuring and managing all Azure resources.

### Outcome
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to integrate Azure App Services with Azure API Management, showcasing skills in API integration, resource management, and web app deployment. The successful testing and validation of the API integration ensured that the web application was effectively exposed and managed through Azure APIM, aligning with best practices for secure and scalable web application development and management.
